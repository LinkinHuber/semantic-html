# semantic-html

## what was the goal of this project?

- The goal of this project was to make the webpage more accessible. I achieved this by replacing all of the `<div>` tags with semantic tags like `<header>, <main>, <footer>,` etc... just to name a few. I added "alt" attributes to all of the images to describe what is happening in them. I came up with a better title for the webpage and I also put all of the headers in the proper order. Some of this effected the CSS so to solve this I changed the `<div>` tags to reflect the semantic tags I added in the HTML. Lastly, I rearanged all of the code in the CSS file to follow the HTML file in chronological order.
