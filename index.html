<!-- This is the meat and potatoes of the webpage which is why I replaced the <div> tags with the <main> tag and added some <section> tags aswell since these are individual sections of information. Also added an "id" for search-engine-optimization since it didn't have one so now when you click the <nav> link above for it it brings you to the right place. Lastly, I added some "alt" attributes to make the images more accessible.-->

Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

<!-- This bit of information is located along the right side of the webpage hence why I replaced the <div> tag with the <aside> tag instead and since these are smaller pieces of information I used some <article> tags. Lastly, I added some "alt" attributes to make the images more accessible. -->
